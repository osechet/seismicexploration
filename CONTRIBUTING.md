## Release Process

To publish a new release of the mod:

1. **Validate changes**
   Make sure all changes are tested and the build passes locally:
   `./gradlew build`

2. **Create a Git tag**
   Create an annotated tag that follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/) and starts with the `v` prefix (for example,
   `v1.2.3`):

  ```sh
  git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
  git push origin vX.Y.Z
  ```

Note: The version is automatically calculated from the SCM using `git describe`. The release page on GitHub is created
by the release workflow. No manual update is required.
